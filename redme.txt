A free,lightweight, and minimally invasive input manager for Unity3D. 

FEATURES: 

- Uses Unity's native Input API (no code changes)
- Editor Window for assigning controls (zero setup code required)
- Multiple controller support
- Default multiplatform keybinding (Mac/Win) for common controllers (Xbox 360, PS3, etc)
- Mouse and keyboard control definitions automatically asigned to first player

Currently DatInput does not feature control remapping during runtime as this would require
writing a completely separate Input library however it will be available in the coming months.

THANKS TO:

- Alec Holowka for sharing InputX which helped inspire DatInput
- PL Young for the excellent tutorial which provided technical expertise for DatInput


HOW TO USE DATINPUT:
- Copy DatInputManager.cs to a folder named 'editor' in your project 'assets' folder
- Open DatInputManager in the Unity Editor via 'Window->DatInput Manager'
- Choose default control type and the max number of players/controllers you wish to support
- Fill out control settings (you must click save for the settings to take effect)
- You can see your changes reflected in the standard Unity Input Manager every time you save
- Use the standard Unity Input API to access input, prefixing action names with "Joy#" e.g. Input.GetAxis("Joy0 Move") - get movement from player 1, Input.GetButton("Joy2 Attack") - see if player 2 pressed attack

Note: Any mouse or keyboard controls will only be assigned to player 1.
