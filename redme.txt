DatInput by Richard3d @RichardCBecker

A free,lightweight, and minimally invasive input manager for Unity3D. 

FEATURES: 

- Uses Unity's native Input API (no code changes)
- Editor Window for assigning controls (zero setup code required)
- Multiple controller support
- Default multiplatform keybinding (Mac/Win) for common controllers (Xbox 360, PS3, etc)
- Mouse and keyboard control definitions automatically asigned to first player

Currently DatInput does not feature control remapping during runtime as this would require
writing a completely separate Input library however it will be available in the coming months.
